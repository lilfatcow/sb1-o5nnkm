    description: |
      Returns all webhook events that were triggered for the specified entity based on your enabled webhook subscriptions.
      These are the same events that were sent to your configured webhook listener endpoints, aggregated into a single list.
      Results can be filtered by the related object type or time period.
      
      You can use this to get the missed events for the time periods when your webhook listener was temporarily unavailable.
      
      We guarantee access to event data only from the last three months. Earlier events may be unavailable.
